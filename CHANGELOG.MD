# CHANGELOG

## [1.18.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.18.1) - 2019-06-12

### Fixes

- Formatter
  - UseCorrectCasing
    - Do not use alias name as key for command info cache to fix the problem where UseCorrectCasing corrects aliases (#1216) (by @bergmeister)
    - Fix wildcard lookups for command lookup and do not append .exe for applications on Windows (#1210) (by @bergmeister)
    - Do not correct applications or script paths at all (#1255) (by @bergmeister)
  - Prevent PSCloseBrace crash if hashtable definition start on first token and there is a PSCloseBrace violation (#1235) (by @bergmeister)
  - PipelineIndentationStyle
    - Fix formatting regression in 1.18.0 whereby single-line pipeline reduces indentation level incorrectly (#1191) (by @bergmeister)
    - Make IncreaseIndentationForFirstPipeline the true default option for PipelineIndentationStyle option (#1218) (by @bergmeister)

- Compatibility Rules
  - Fix UseCompatibleSyntax class error message (#1215) (by @rjmholt)
  - Convert compatibility module to binary module, fix compatibility with Azure environments (#1212) (by @rjmholt)
  - Prevent .NET members with names differing only by case from crashing the compatibility profiler (#1195) (by @rjmholt)
  - Fix compatibility profile query API so that aliases referring to other modules appear (#1194) (by @rjmholt)
  
- DSC
  - Instead of using the first cimClass and then having no superClass, use the first cimClass that has a non-null superClass (#1200) (by @bergmeister, thanks to @ykuijs! for the great collaboration)
  - Make `-SaveDscDependency` work on Linux (#1246) (by @bergmeister)
  
- Enable suppression of custom rules when used together with `-IncludeDefaultRules` to allow all possible scenarios from 1.17.1 and 1.18.0. This removes also the check if the rule name in the suppression attribute can be found because this check is technically not possible in all scenarios (#1245) (by @bergmeister)
- Fix NullReferenceException for class type (#1182) (by @bergmeister)

### Performance

2 improvements were made that make cold runs of ScriptAnalyzer twice as fast compared to `1.18.0`

- Speedup cold runs by using a runspace pool (#1178) (by @bergmeister)
- Fix logic errors in AvoidAlias rule to halve the amount of necessary calls to `Get-Command`, making the rule twice (#1251) (by @JamesWTruher)

### General Improvements

## [1.18.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.18.0) - 2019-03-21

### Breaking Changes

- Minimum required version of `PowerShell Core` was raised from `6.0.2` to `6.1.0` due to `6.0` having reached the end of its support life-cycle. (#1165)
- Updated used version of `Newtonsoft.Json` to `11.0.2`. (#1165) (by @bergmeister)
- Command data files of PowerShell `6.0` were removed. Updated files for PowerShell `6.1` were added. This means that users that have customized the `UseCompatibleCmdlets` rule, need to either adapt the version string as per rule documentation or can alternatively copy in the old command data files into the `Settings` installation folder (#1075) (by @bergmeister)
- The minimum required runtime of the full .Net Framework was raised from `4.5.1` to `4.5.2` as `4.5.1` is not supported any more. If the OS is patched then Windows update will have ensured that the newer runtime patch is available. (#1108) (by @bergmeister)
- Emit parsing errors as diagnostic records (#1130) (by @JamesWTruher)

### Formatter Rules

- Add `UseCorrectCasing` formatting rule for cmdlet/function name (#1117) (by @bergmeister)
- Fix `PSUseConsistentIndentationRule` to handle pipes correctly when there is a multi-line statement after a pipe and add `PipelineIndentation` customisation option for it (#1102) (by @bergmeister)
- Add `CheckInnerBrace` and `CheckPipe` options to `PSUseConsistentWhitespace` (#1092) (by @bergmeister)

### Script Analysis Rules

- Add command data file for PowerShell `2.0` (#1091) (by @bergmeister)
- Add command data files of PowerShell `6.1.0` (#1075) (by @bergmeister)
- New PowerShell compatibility rules: `UseCompatibleCommands`, `UseCompatibleSyntax` and `UseCompatibleTypes` (#1156, #1133, #1176 and #1179) (by @rjmholt and @JamesWTruher)
- Make `PossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull` rule return a `SuggestCorrection` for auto-fixes in VS-Code or via the -Fix switch (#1115) (by @bergmeister)
- Make UseCompatibleCmdlets not throw if default reference desktop-5.1.14393.206-windows is specified in the list of platforms and use core-6.1.0-windows as an alternative default reference (#1043 and #1075) (by @bergmeister)

### Custom Rules

- Translate `RuleSuppressionID` for custom rules as well (#1144) (by @bergmeister)
- Allow for suppression of custom rules (#1145) (by @bergmeister)

### DSC

- Add support for Hashtable syntax of `Import-DscRessource` for `-SaveDscDependency` switch (#1138) (by @bergmeister)
- Take module version into account for `-SaveDscDependency` switch (#1094) (by @bergmeister)

### Performance

Multi-threading efficiency was highly improved leading to a speedup whilst keeping the CPU usage roughly the same. One can expect `PSScriptAnalyzer` (PSSA) 1.18.0 to be more than twice as fast in most situations (including 'cold' runs) compared to its predecessor 1.17.0.

- Increase lock granularity for CommandInfo cache #1166 (by @bergmeister and @rjmholt)

- Ensure correct disposal with using statement (#1164) (by @bergmeister)
- Fix bug that caused Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer to not run any rule after an execution of Invoke-Formatter in the same session (but Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer would've recovered when being called again) (#1121) (by @bergmeister)
- Fix parsing of empty hashtable when string is provided as settings object (#1073) (by @bergmeister)
- Fix AlignAssignment rule to calculate alignment position correctly and avoid crash (#1070) (by @bergmeister)
- Don't crash on CIM classes with no superclass (#1046) (Thanks @edyoung!)
- Trigger AvoidPositionalParameters rule for function defined and called inside a script. (#963 and #1175) (Thanks @kalgiz! and @bergmeister)
- Add OutputType attributes to cmdlets to enhance tab completion (#1020) (by @bergmeister)
- Allow paths to be pipelined to Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer (#1040) (Thanks @edyoung!)

## [1.16.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.16.1) - 2017-09-01
### Fixed
- (#815) Formatter crashes due to invalid extent comparisons

## [1.16.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.16.0) - 2017-08-15
### Added
- (#803) `CustomRulePath`, `RecurseCustomRulePath` and `IncludeDefaultRules` parameters to settings file.

### Fixed
- (#801) Reading DSC classes in `PSUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC` rule.
- (#796) `PSAvoidUsingWriteHost` rule documentation (Thanks @bergmeister!).

## [1.15.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.15.0) - 2017-06-21

### Added
- (#780) `Range` parameter to the `Invoke-Formatter` cmdlet. The user can specify the range in which formatting should be applied. The primary usage for this parameter is to be used with editors that request selection formatting.
- (#782, #788) Allman style, Stroustrup style and one true brace style (OTBS) code formatting presets.
- (#790) `Kind` switch to `PSUseConsistentIndentation` rule to provide tabbed indentation.

### Fixed
- (#781, #784) `NewLineAfer` switch behavior in `PSPlaceCloseBrace` rule. When the switch is set to `$false`, the emitted suggested corrections enforce branching control statements to be on the same line as their preceding closing braces. On the other hand when the switch is set to `$true`, the emitted suggested corrections enforce branching controls statements to be on the next line.

Many thanks to @rkeithhill for contributing the _Stroustrup_ style code formatting preset.

## [1.14.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.14.1) - 2017-06-12

### Fixed
- (#777) `Invoke-Formatter`
    - Make the cmdlet parameters positional.
    - Updated documentation so that `Get-Help Invoke-Formatter -Syntax` returns a valid syntax.

## [1.14.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.14.0) - 2017-06-09

### Added
- (#772) [`Invoke-Formatter`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/4f47ef95edd045029628ba9a4079b1dda19f080f/docs/markdown/Invoke-Formatter.md) cmdlet to format PowerShell scripts. The cmdlet takes a script string and a settings file and outputs formatted script string based on the provided settings. If no settings are provided, the formatter uses the default `CodeFormatting` settings, which can be found at `Settings/CodeFormatting.psd1`.

### Fixed
- (#770) `PSUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC` rule violation extent. The violation extent covers only the relevant function name, which prior the fix would mark the entire script. This prevented rule suppression from working when the suppression is declared inside `Get/Set/Test` functions.
- (#770) `PSUseIdenticalMandatoryParametersForDSC` behavior to look for mandatory parameters in `Get/Set/Test` functions in a script based resource only if they are declared with attributes, `Key` or `Required`, in the corresponding `mof` file.

## [1.13.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.13.0) - 2017-05-18

### Added
- [`PSUseSupportsShouldProcess`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/f92dabdef61b87d5f9f9f2140739c9f3f210b2d8/RuleDocumentation/UseSupportsShouldProcess.md) rule to discourage manual `whatif` and `confirm` parameter declarations.
- Suggested corrections to [`PSProvideCommentHelp`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/f92dabdef61b87d5f9f9f2140739c9f3f210b2d8/RuleDocumentation/ProvideCommentHelp.md) rule. The rule can now be configured to:
    - trigger on non-exported functions. But by default, the rule triggers only on exported functions that do have comment help.
    - place the suggested corrections either before a function definition, or at the beginning or end of a function's body.
    - choose between block comment or line comment style of suggested comment help correction.

### Fixed
- `PSAlignAssignmentStatement` to align assignment statements in DSC configurations that have *Undefined DSC Resource* parse errors.

## [1.12.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.12.0) - 2017-05-09

### Added
- [PSAlignAssignmentRuleStatement](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/cca9a2d7ee35be7322f8c5a09b6c500a0a8bd101/RuleDocumentation/AlignAssignmentStatement.md) rule to align assignment statements in property value pairs (#753).

### Fixed
- `PSAvoidGlobalVars` rule to ignore `$global:lastexitcode` (#752).
- `PSUseConsistentIndentation` to account for backtick on preceding line (#749).
- `PSPlaceCloseBrace` to ignore one-line blocks when `NewLineAfter` switch is on (#748).

## [1.11.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.11.1) - 2017-04-04
### Fixed
- CodeFormatting settings file (#727, #728).
- Whitelisted aliases comparison in AvoidUsingCmdletAliases rule (#739).
- PlaceCloseBrace rule behavior for NewLineAfter option (#741).
- UseConsistentIndentation rule to ignore open brace in magic methods (#744).

## [1.11.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.11.0) - 2017-03-01
### Added
- Built-in settings presets to specify settings from command line (#717). Currently, PSSA ships with `PSGallery`, `CodeFormatting`, `DSC`, and other settings presets. All of them can be found in the `Settings/` directory in the module. To use them just pass them as an argument to the `Settings` parameter. For example, if you want to run rules that *powershellgallery* runs, then use the following command.
```powershell
PS> Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path /path/to/your/module -Settings PSGallery
```
- Argument completion for built-in settings presets (#717).
- Argument completion for `IncludeRule` and `ExcludeRule` parameters (#717).
- Option to `PSCloseBrace` rule to add new line after the brace (#713).
- Option to `PSCloseBrace` rule to ignore expressions that have open and close braces on the same line (#706).
- New rule, [PSUseConsistentWhitespace](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/9a6fe537c11c9c8d7ed872a7464eb192cab00883/RuleDocumentation/UseConsistentWhitespace.md), to check for whitespace style around operators and separators (#702).

### Fixed
- Indentation when pipes precede new lines in a multi-line command expression in `PSUseConsistentIdentation` rule (#705).
- Handling of SubExpressionAsts (`$(...)`) in `PSUseConsistentIdentation` rule (#700).
- Performance issues caused by `get-command` cmdlet (#695).

### Changed
- Settings implementation to decouple it from engine (#717).

## [1.10.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.10.0) - 2017-01-19
### Added
- Three rules to enable code formatting feature in vscode (#690)
    - [PSPlaceOpenBrace](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/03a6e2b4ee24894bf574a8a8ce911d03680da607/RuleDocumentation/PlaceOpenBrace.md)
    - [PSPlaceCloseBrace](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/03a6e2b4ee24894bf574a8a8ce911d03680da607/RuleDocumentation/PlaceCloseBrace.md)
    - [PSUseConsistentIdentation](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/03a6e2b4ee24894bf574a8a8ce911d03680da607/RuleDocumentation/UseConsistentIndentation.md)

### Fixed
- `PSProvideCommentHelp` violation extent (#679)
- `PSAvoidUsingCmdletAliases` rule
    + false positives in DSC configurations (#678)
    + violation extent (#685)
- `PSDSCDSCTestsPresent` rule to check for tests in subdirectories

    + trigger only if invoked from PS version 4 and below
    + violation extent
- `PSAvoidUsingComputerNameHardcoded` rule to ignore `localhost` (#687)
- Performance issues caused by invoking `get-command` method (#692)

## [1.9.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/1.9.0) - 2016-12-06
